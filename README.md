Cement Plant Dust Emissions Optimization

This project aimed to reduce atmospheric dust emissions in a cement packaging plant by identifying and optimizing key operational parameters using SQL and Python.

🚀 Project Objective

To analyze plant performance data, identify variables that influence dust emissions the most, implement changes, and evaluate the results.

🧠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
MySQL (Data management and querying)
Jupyter Notebook (Analysis and storytelling)

📊 Dataset Features

Dust concentration (mg/m³)
Inlet gas flow rate (m³/hr)
Temperature (°C)
Differential pressure (kPa)
Residue (%) – a cement fineness metric

🔍 Analytical Approach

Data cleaning and preparation in SQL
Exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis in Python
Regression modeling to understand key influences
Visualization of pre- and post-optimization results
Suggested operational recommendations

📈 Key Insights
